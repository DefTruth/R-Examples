#' Research synthesis tools to facilitate systematic reviews, data extraction, 
#' and meta-analysis.
#'
#' \pkg{metagear} is a comprehensive, multifunctional toolbox with capabilities 
#' aimed to cover much of the research synthesis taxonomy: from applying a 
#' systematic review approach to objectively assemble and screen the literature, 
#' to extracting data from studies, and to finally summarize and analyse these data 
#' with the statistics of meta-analysis.  The complete list of functions can be 
#' viewed with \code{library(help = metagear)}.  More information about 
#' \pkg{metagear} can be found at \url{http://lajeunesse.myweb.usf.edu} .
