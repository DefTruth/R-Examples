#' @title Wheat grain weight measurements after anthesis
#' @description
#' Darroch and Baker (1990) studied grain filling in three spring wheat genotypes.
#' The data are seed weights of the spring wheat cultivar Neepawa in three different years 1986, 1987, 1988.
#' These data were numerised from figure of the article, so they present slight difference with original data.
#' @docType data
#' @usage seedweight.data
#' @format a \code{RangedData} instance, 1 row per measurement. DD = Degree Days after anthesis; seedweight = Wheat grain weight (mg)
