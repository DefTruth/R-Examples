#' Redistributes title/abstract screening efforts among a review team.#'#' Randomly re-distributes screening tasks from one reviewers to the rest of the #' reviewing team.  Used when screening effort needs to be re-allocated among#' reviewing team members.    #'#' @param aDataFrame A data.frame containing the titles and abstracts to be #'    screened by a team.  The default assumes that the data.frame has already #'    been formatted using \code{effort_initialize} and populated with #'    \code{effort_distribute}.#' @param column_name Changes the default label of the "REVIEWERS" column #'    that contains the screening efforts of each team member. #' @param reviewer The name of the reviewer whose effort is to be redistributed. #' @param remove_effort The percentage of effort to be redistributed among the team.   #'    The default is that 100\% of the effort will be re-distributed.#' @param reviewers A vector of the names of each team member that will take on#'    additional work.#' @param effort A vector of percentages used to allocate screening#'    tasks among each team member.  When not called explicitly, assumes effort #'    to be distributed evenly among all members.  Must be the same length as #'    the number of team members, and also sum to 100.  #' @param save_split Saves the allocated team effort into separate "effort_*.csv"#'    files for individual screening tasks.  These files can be given to each#'    member to screen their random title/abstract subset.  All files can be #'    merged once all screening tasks have been completed using #'    \code{effort_merge}.  #' @param directory Changes the default location/directory for where the  #'    "effort_*.csv" will be saved.  If not explicitly called, it will deposit #'    files in the current working directory.#'#' @return A single data.frame with effort re-allocated among team members.#'#' @importFrom utils read.csv#' @export effort_redistributeeffort_redistribute <- function (aDataFrame,                                 column_name = "REVIEWERS",                                 reviewer = NULL,                                  remove_effort = 100,                                  reviewers = NULL,                                  effort = NULL,                                 save_split = FALSE,                                 directory = getwd()) {    split_dataFrame <- split(aDataFrame, aDataFrame[, column_name])  redist_dataFrame <- split_dataFrame[reviewer]  split_dataFrame[reviewer] <- NULL    if(is.null(reviewers) == TRUE) reviewers <- levels(aDataFrame[,column_name])  if (length(reviewers) == 1) {        new_dataFrame <- redist_dataFrame    new_dataFrame[[1]][column_name] <- reviewers      } else {      if(remove_effort != 100) theTeam <- reviewers    else if (length(reviewers) < length(levels(aDataFrame[,column_name]))) theTeam <- reviewers    else theTeam <- reviewers[ -which(reviewers %in% reviewer)]        number_reviewers <- length(theTeam)        if(!is.null(effort)) {        teamEffort <- (remove_effort/100) * round((number_reviewers * (effort / 100)))        effort <- c(100 - remove_effort, teamEffort)    }        new_dataFrame <- list(effort_distribute(redist_dataFrame[[1]],                                        theTeam,                                        effort = effort,                                        column_name = column_name,                                        dual = FALSE,                                        initialize = FALSE,                                        save_split = FALSE))        }       newDataFrame <- Reduce(function(...) rbind(...), c(split_dataFrame, new_dataFrame))    if(save_split == TRUE) effort_save(newDataFrame, column_name, directory)    return(newDataFrame)}
