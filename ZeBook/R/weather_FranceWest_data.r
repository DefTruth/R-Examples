#' @title Weather series for western France from NASA POWER agroclimatology
#' @description This contemporary daily climate dataset for West of France
#' covers the period 1st January 1984 to 31 December 2011.
#' The precipitation data is limited to the period Jan-1997 Aug-2009, thus only 12 complete
#' years of data were available for  analysis involving precipitation(1997 to 2009).
#' It cover main part of West part of France defined as a rectangle.
#' The dataset was extracted from the NASA Langley Research Center POWER Project which provide
#' agroclimatology dataset (Chandler et al., 2004). 
#' It was funded through the NASA Earth Science Directorate Applied Science Program
#' This climate dataset contains daily estimates of precipitation, mean, minimum and
#' maximum temperature, relative humidity, dew point, solar radiation
#' and wind speed with global coverage at one degree resolution
#' (approximately 111 km at the equator).
#' The NASA POWER agroclimatology data are derived from various
#' sources: solar radiation from satellite observations, meteorological
#' data from the Goddard Earth Observing System global assimilation
#' model version 4 (GEOS-4), and precipitation from the Global
#' Precipitation Climate Project and Topical Rainfall Measurement
#' Mission. A full description can be found at
